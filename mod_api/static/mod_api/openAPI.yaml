        This will override any value of `Accept` in the request headers.
        Possible values are `html`, `jsonld`, `ttl` and `rdfxml`. 

        - `html` a web page that is the most appropriate to answer the call.

        - `jsonld` (default) a JSON-LD representation of the result.

        - `ttl` a ttl representation of the result.

        - `rdfxml` a RDF/XML representation of the result.

This abstract entity combines the FRBR entities work (a distinct intellectual or artistic creation) and expression (the intellectual or artistic realization of a work). Assets can be versioned. Every time the intellectual content of an asset changes, the result is considered to be a new asset that can be linked to previous and next versions of the Asset. The physical embodiment of an Asset is called an Asset Distribution. A particular Asset may have zero or more Asset Distributions.

Where appropriate, named places or time periods may be used in preference to numeric identifiers such as sets of coordinates or date ranges.
